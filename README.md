# Flag 

Flag is an acronym Formal Language Analyzer Generator and that pretty much describes the functionality of this project.

## Formal Languages

Formal languages are a set of rules described upon an alphabet that resolves to a set of words, this type of construction is very powerful when solving a problem that requires a strict shape for possible solutions and it's the base for all programming languages.

## The compilation process

Programming languages are usually run in a computer, and the computer's processor has a closed set of instructions that are built directly on the chip, so if you want to "speak" with the processor, you have to use it's language (usually binary code, with each word representing one instruction that should be executed). The process of transforming your code into machine code is called compilation and is a whole area of study inside computer science.

If you don't know anything about compilation, probably this project is useless for you, but you can always learn and return here to use Flag. I would recommend starting with the book **"Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools"** which served as a guide for my introductory course on formal languages on college. It starts from the basics on compilation, but it's necessary to have previous knowledge on some basic discrete mathematics concepts.

## What Flag can do

Currently we cover two out of three steps on the analysis phase of the compilation process, Flag can generate and run the lexical and syntatic analyzers based on JSON configuration files passed as input. It also can raise lexical and syntatic errors while validating your code.

You can install Flag and use it as a CLI application or you can add it to your python application as a library and use our interface to build some awesome things.

I could really use help on building meaningful and cool examples of languages, check out the `samples` folder to see the format for examples.
